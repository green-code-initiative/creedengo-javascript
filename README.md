# Creedengo-JS

_creedengo_ is a collective project aiming to reduce environmental footprint of software at the code level. The goal of the project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to highlight code structures that may have a negative ecological impact: energy and resources over-consumption, "fatware", shortening terminals' lifespan, etc.

Websites are becoming increasingly heavy and complex over the years. They represent an important part
of the digital environmental footprint. The JavaScript/TypeScript part of the project focuses on providing rules and guidelines to optimize web applications and server-side code written in JavaScript and TypeScript.

## üåø SonarQube plugin

_Creedengo_ JavaScript is an "eco-responsibility" static code analyzer for projects based on the JavaScript ecosystem. It
can handle JavaScript, TypeScript and all frameworks that use them. Its main purpose is to work with website source
code, but it can also analyze back-end code.

This project proposes rules for the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- NestJS
- React (JSX)
- React Native / Expo

## üîß ESLint plugin

This project uses an internal ESLint plugin to analyze your source code.

If you are not using SonarQube, we have a solution for you: the linter is working nicely on its own! \
Follow instructions in the [dedicated README file](eslint-plugin/README.md) to use it as a standalone plugin.
